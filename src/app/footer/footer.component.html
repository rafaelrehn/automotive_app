    Há quase 30 anos a Leon Automóveis vem sendo refernecia na venda de veículos Premium, atendendo não somente à Santa Rosa,  e sim à toda região. Após 22 anos de instalação na Avenida Expedicionário Weber, operação que nos proporcionou excelentes negócios e muita experiência no ramo, passamos a aderir um novo conceito de compra e venda de automóveis. Seguindo as novas tendências do merdado, optamos por atender nossos clientes, amigos e os interessados na compra de bons carros somente através dos canais digitais. A qualidade dos carros é a mesma, e o atendimento diferenciado de sempre passa a ser ainda melhor.
